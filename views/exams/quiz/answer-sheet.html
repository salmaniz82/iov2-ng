The idea for Harry Potter books came to Rowling on a train. She was<br>
traveling from Manchester to London. Suddenly she thought of a book about a<br>
boy named Harry with magic powers. She was immediately very excited. She<br>
knew it was a good idea and she knew it was going to be fun to write. She<br>
thought about the book for the rest of the trip. By the time she arrived in<br>
London, many things were clear to her. She knew the names of Harry’s friends<br>
and of his school. In addition, she knew what would happen to him in the book.<br>
She also knew that she is going to write seven books about Harry Potter. At the<br>
time, Rowling was working on another novel. However, she left that and started<br>
writing about Harry Potter.<br>
Soon after that, she moved to Manchester, England, to live with a friend.<br>
She only stayed there a short while. That year, after many years of illness, her<br>
mother died. Rowling was very unhappy. She decided that she needed to leave<br>
England for a while. Therefore, she went to Oporto, Portugal, and taught English<br>
in a language school. After six months, she met a Portuguese journalist, Jorge<br>
Arantes. They got married and the next year their daughter Jessica was born.<br>
This was a very happy moment in Rowling’s life. However, the happy times did<br>
not last. After only a few months, Rowling realized the marriage was not<br>
working. She also needed a better job, so she decided to leave Portugal. She and<br>
Jessica went to live near Rowling’s sister in Edinburgh, Scotland.<br>
All this time, Rowling was working on the first Harry Potter book. In<br>
Edinburgh, it was hard for her to find time for writing. She was taking courses to<br>
become a teacher, and she had to take care of little Jessica. Rowling often took<br>
Jessica for long walks until the child fell asleep. Then she took her to café,<br>
ordered a cup of coffee, and started writing.<br>

The idea for Harry Potter books came to Rowling on a train. She was<br>
traveling from Manchester to London. Suddenly she thought of a book about a<br>
boy named Harry with magic powers. She was immediately very excited. She<br>
knew it was a good idea and she knew it was going to be fun to write. She<br>
thought about the book for the rest of the trip. By the time she arrived in<br>
London, many things were clear to her. She knew the names of Harry’s friends<br>
and of his school. In addition, she knew what would happen to him in the book.<br>
She also knew that she is going to write seven books about Harry Potter. At the<br>
time, Rowling was working on another novel. However, she left that and started<br>
writing about Harry Potter.<br>
Soon after that, she moved to Manchester, England, to live with a friend.<br>
She only stayed there a short while. That year, after many years of illness, her<br>
mother died. Rowling was very unhappy. She decided that she needed to leave<br>
England for a while. Therefore, she went to Oporto, Portugal, and taught English<br>
in a language school. After six months, she met a Portuguese journalist, Jorge<br>
Arantes. They got married and the next year their daughter Jessica was born.<br>
This was a very happy moment in Rowling’s life. However, the happy times did<br>
not last. After only a few months, Rowling realized the marriage was not<br>
working. She also needed a better job, so she decided to leave Portugal. She and<br>
Jessica went to live near Rowling’s sister in Edinburgh, Scotland.<br>
All this time, Rowling was working on the first Harry Potter book. In<br>
Edinburgh, it was hard for her to find time for writing. She was taking courses to<br>
become a teacher, and she had to take care of little Jessica. Rowling often took<br>
Jessica for long walks until the child fell asleep. Then she took her to café,<br>
ordered a cup of coffee, and started writing.<br>
